## Installing:
  - `sudo make install`
  - Set the icon theme using gnome-tweaks, or `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme Argon`

## Building:
  - It's not necessary to rebuild the theme to install, only if modifications have been made
  - `make build -jX` will autoclean, then generate changed icons and `index.theme`
  - `make regen -jX` will regenerate all icons, whether they have been changed or not, and `index.theme`
  - `make clean` will delete all generated icons and `index.theme`
  - `make autoclean` will delete icons missing a corresponding svg, broken symlinks and empty directories, then prune
  - `make prune` will delete rubbish elements and attributes from the svgs
  - `make index` will generate `index.theme` (Done automatically by `build` and `regen`)
  - `make check` will check all defined symlinks are valid
  - `make install` will copy the theme in its current state to the install location, check and generate any symlinks, then run `make refresh`
  - `make refresh` will generate an icon cache for the theme
