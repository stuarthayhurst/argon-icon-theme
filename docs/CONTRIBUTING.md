## Working with issues:
 - If someone else is already working on a reported, feel free help them out. Please don't try and commandeer the issue, if you want to work on something on your own, find another issue
 - Please report issues before submitting a pull request to fix them
 - If you are working on your own issue, use that report as a space to track information and progress relating to the issue
 - If any help is required, please make it known, instead of silently dropping the issue

## Adding an icon:
 - **Icons should follow the guidelines in `docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`**
 - Icons are created via svg files in `argon/scalable/[context]/icon.svg`
 - Icon templates can be found in `guides/`, and should be followed to match the style of the theme
 - The icons need to be regenerated, as stated below
 - Any text used should be converted from text to a path

## Building and installing the icon theme:
  > Generating new icons:
   - If new icons have been added, or existing icons changed, the build system can handle updating only changed icons:
   - `make build -j$(nproc)`
   - Alternatively, `make regen -j$(nproc)` will completely clear the project and regenerate all assets
   - If a new icon category / context was added, or values were changed for an existing one, run `make index`
  > Adding new symlinks:
   - If a new symlink is required, do the following:
     - Look in `argon/symlinks/` for the `.list` file corresponding to the icon's category
     - Add a new line to the file, ensuring the alphabetical order is preserved
     - Fill in the line with `newIcon.svg -> targetIcon.svg`
     - `targetIcon.svg` should already exist, and `newIcon.svg` will be created at install time
     - Run `make check`, to validate the symlinks
     - Example: `blender.svg -> new-blender.svg`
     - Please use a relative path, as the symlinks are generated exactly with the given data in the install directory
  > Installing:
   - Install with `sudo make install`
   - Uninstall with `sudo make uninstall`
   - Set the theme using gnome-tweaks, or `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme Argon`
  > Cleaning assets:
   - `make clean` will delete all generated icons and `index.theme`
   - `make autoclean` will remove clutter (icons missing a corresponding svg, broken symlinks and empty directories)
